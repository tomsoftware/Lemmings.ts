# Lemmings.ts

this is a Lemmings clone written in JavaScript (more precisely in TypeScript a dialectal of JavaScript). 


## Binaries are missing
You should be able to play all level of the game but before you can do so, you need to copy the original
 data-files of all Lemmings variants to the respective folders e.g. "lemming", "lemming_Holiday93", ...

If you don't want to play one of this variants or you don't have the data-files you may need to disable 
 this Lemmings-variant in the ´config.json´.


## start the game
To start the game, just open the ´lemmings.html´ file.

Have fun!
